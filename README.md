# Machine-Learning-Project---Diabetes-Prediction-using-SVM

Objective:

Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health indicators such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

Achievements:

-- Successfully collected and preprocessed the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, addressing missing values and standardizing features. 

-- Implemented and trained an SVM model with an RBF kernel, achieving an accuracy of 85%. 

-- Conducted hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search to optimize model performance. 

-- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving improved metrics. 

-- Deployed the predictive model for real-time diabetes prediction. 

-- Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, SVM, Grid Search, Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation, Hyperparameter Tuning
